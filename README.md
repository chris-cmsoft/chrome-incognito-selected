# Chrome Incognito Selected Tabs
Moves any highlighted tabs (single or multi) into a new / existing incognito window. 

# Install ?
git clone, go to chrome extensions, load unpacked, select folder.

# Usage ?
Select tabs you want to take incognito, click extension, and "Go Incognito".

The tabs will open in incognito and close in current browser.

Clicking "Go Incognito" Will open a new incognito window, unless extension is enabled for incognito windows.

Generally, don't do this, but if you live on the edge and want tabs to open in the same incognito window, activate the plugin for incognito windows as well. 

If you don't trust the extension enough, the code's all here, so you can have a squiz around. There really isn't much code :) 


# Enhancements that could be made possibly

* Remove current tabs from history
